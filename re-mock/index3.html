<h3>///Q2.Check whether the condition is fulfilled or not?</h3>
<p>Write a program that takes a number and prints whether the number is divisible by 
    6

      <p>You are given an integer 
        A
        , denoting the age of a person, and your task is to determine whether he/she is eligible to vote or not.

<h3>///Q4.Find Relation</h3>
<p>PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
    X
     and 
    Y
     and asks you to find the relation between them. <br>
    The relationships between integers 
    X
     and 
    Y
     are as follows: <br>
    
    If 
    X
    <
    Y
    , it means that 
    X
     is smaller than 
    Y 
    . <br>
    If 
    X
    >
    Y
    , it means that 
    X
     is greater than 
    Y 
    . <br>
    If 
    X
    =
    Y
    , it means that 
    X
     is equal to 
    Y 
    . <br>
    Note: You have to complete findRelationship function. No need to take any input.
    
    </p>
    const findRelation = (x,y) => { <br>
        if(x < y ){ <br>
          return x + " is smaller than "+ y; <br>
        } <br>
        else if(x>y){ <br>
          return x + " is greater than "+ y; <br>
        } <br>
        else { <br>
          return x + " is equal to " + y; <br>
        } <br>
